Lets' install streamlit library in your own virtual environment ;
## https://docs.streamlit.io/get-started/installation
pip install streamlit
streamlit run **.py

You should understand the data visualization before runing streamlit !!

That's why you understand the modules like Pandas(gorupby), matplotlib, seaborn.
